# network_analyzer
Checks, in a network, the availbility of the IPs and ports pre defined in netconf.txt

Use netconf.txt to set the IPs and they respective ports, then run analisador_de_rede.py to scan all the possible IPs and ports in the network and create a netlog.txt file that describes if there is an anomaly in the response or if the IP and the port are responding as expected
